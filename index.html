          <h3>How does an individual become part of a group?</h3>
          <p>
            Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and
            beliefs that can be seen among Americans collectively, there are
            thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which
            citizens can belong. The terms group and organization are very loose
            and can be interpreted very broadly. Some groups are very general
            and open to all without question while others may have specific
            goals or very selective membership. They can be economically
            motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue organizations.
            However, we can break them down into political organizations,
            interest groups, voluntary and civic associations, unions, and
            religious groups. View the slideshow below to learn more.

          <p>
            Political organizations have the general goal of trying to either
            influence or take control of government to achieve outcomes.
            Political parties, such as the Democrats, Republicans, and
            Libertarians, all fall in the category, but one might also find
            groups such as FreedomWorks or the Center for American Progress.
            Depending on the group or organization, citizens may find membership
            in them a challenge as political parties often take time to join in
            an active level, or groups may insist on alignment with
            philosophical goals.

          <p>
            Interest groups tend to be centered on a common goal or idea. These
            groups run the table in terms of interests and concerns, including
            the National Organization for Women, La Raza, National Right to
            Life, and the National Rifle Association. Many could be considered
            political as they have aims to influence leadership. However,
            membership tends to be less restrictive as many look for volunteers
            to help spread their messages and ideas.

            Volunteering and civic participation tends to be the most local
            level of group membership. Often parts of larger organizations,
            these groups are often charitable, and work for general causes, or
            serve as a means of fraternal support. Such groups differ widely,
            with some very open to anyone interested, such as the Red Cross or
            United Way, and others with very selective membership procedures,
            such as the Elks or Freemasons.

            Unions were created to support the needs of workers in various
            fields of industry and service and are responsible for helping to
            promote safe workplaces and fair labor practices. Over the years,
            unions have often increased their activities to include charitable
            works and political involvement to support candidates and ideas that
            serve to aid their general membership. Unions include the AFL-CIO
            and the NEA. Union membership is selective in that one must usually
            be employed in a particular field to join; however, in some places
            union membership is actually mandatory by state law if employed in
            certain jobs.

            Religious groups is a very broad category as it can refer to
            specific religious denominations or sects, or it can refer to
            organizations and societies that support the views of particular
            religions and belief systems. For example, entire denominations have
            lobbying organizations to petition on their behalf. Other
            organizations exist to promote the ideas of a religious group, such
            as the Anti-Defamation League, which exists to prevent persecution
            of Jewish citizens, and the Knights of Columbus, an association of
            Catholic men. Generally, membership in groups requires adherence to
            the beliefs of the sect or denomination, but some have more
            stringent requirements for participation.

          <p>Q: Do some organizations and groups overlap categories?</p>
          <!-- Reveal Hidden Answer -->
          <p>
            A: Yes. Many organizations could fall under the idea of political
            organizations or interest groups since they tend to aim for
            political influence and focus on areas of common interest. However,
            some are more explicitly political, while others have politics as a
            goal among many.
