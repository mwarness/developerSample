              Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and
              beliefs that can be seen among Americans collectively, there are
              thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which
              citizens can belong. The terms group and organization are very
              loose and can be interpreted very broadly. Some groups are very
              general and open to all without question while others may have
              specific goals or very selective membership. They can be
              economically motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue
              organizations. However, we can break them down into political
              organizations, interest groups, voluntary and civic associations,
              unions, and religious groups. View the slideshow below to learn
              more.

                <br />
                <img

                <p>
                  Political organizations have the general goal of trying to
                  either influence or take control of government to achieve
                  outcomes. Political parties, such as the Democrats,
                  Republicans, and Libertarians, all fall in the category, but
                  one might also find groups such as FreedomWorks or the Center
                  for American Progress. Depending on the group or organization,
                  citizens may find membership in them a challenge as political
                  parties often take time to join in an active level, or groups
                  may insist on alignment with philosophical goals.

                <h5>Interest Groups</h5>
                <br />
                <img src="assets/images/nra.jpeg" alt="NRA official seal" />
                <br />
                <p>
                  Interest groups tend to be centered on a common goal or idea.
                  These groups run the table in terms of interests and concerns,
                  including the National Organization for Women, La Raza,
                  National Right to Life, and the National Rifle Association.
                  Many could be considered political as they have aims to
                  influence leadership. However, membership tends to be less
                  restrictive as many look for volunteers to help spread their
                  messages and ideas.

                <h5>Voluntary and Civic Associations</h5>

                <br />
                <p>
                  Volunteering and civic participation tends to be the most
                  local level of group membership. Often parts of larger
                  organizations, these groups are often charitable, and work for
                  general causes, or serve as a means of fraternal support. Such
                  groups differ widely, with some very open to anyone
                  interested, such as the Red Cross or United Way, and others
                  with very selective membership procedures, such as the Elks or
                  Freemasons.

                <h5>Unions</h5>

                <br />
                <p>
                  Unions were created to support the needs of workers in various
                  fields of industry and service and are responsible for helping
                  to promote safe workplaces and fair labor practices. Over the
                  years, unions have often increased their activities to include
                  charitable works and political involvement to support
                  candidates and ideas that serve to aid their general
                  membership. Unions include the AFL-CIO and the NEA. Union
                  membership is selective in that one must usually be employed
                  in a particular field to join; however, in some places union
                  membership is actually mandatory by state law if employed in
                  certain jobs.

                <br />
                <p>
                  Religious groups is a very broad category as it can refer to
                  specific religious denominations or sects, or it can refer to
                  organizations and societies that support the views of
                  particular religions and belief systems. For example, entire
                  denominations have lobbying organizations to petition on their
                  behalf. Other organizations exist to promote the ideas of a
                  religious group, such as the Anti-Defamation League, which
                  exists to prevent persecution of Jewish citizens, and the
                  Knights of Columbus, an association of Catholic men.
                  Generally, membership in groups requires adherence to the
                  beliefs of the sect or denomination, but some have more
                  stringent requirements for participation.

            Yes. Many organizations could fall under the idea of political
            organizations or interest groups since they tend to aim for
            political influence and focus on areas of common interest. However,
            some are more explicitly political, while others have politics as a
            goal among many.
