            What words should you know to appreciate the rest of Part I of the
            novel?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Although Miyax has finally made friends with Amaroq and the other
            wolves in his pack, she is still struggling to survive. Getting
            Jello to share some meat from his "belly basket" had been a
            desperate and dangerous move on her part, and she can't rely on this
            method forever. The next time she tries, he might attack her instead
            of giving in to his "babysitting" instincts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the rest of Part I of Julie of the Wolves, the
            protagonist continues her quest to stay alive in spite of the
            harshness of the elements, a shortage of food, and her loneliness.
            Some of the words below may be unfamiliar to you, and yet they will
            be helpful in understanding Miyax's difficult situation even after
            winning Amaroq's trust.

            describe someone's attempt to survive alone in the Alaskan tundra.

            novel.
